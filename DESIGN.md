Core Website Generation Prompt

Design a personal website that behaves like an infinite, scrollable, and pannable canvas, similar to a boundless white void. In the center is a continuously expanding universe of floating “overseer engineer” scenes, depicting the same character performing surreal, corporate, and procedural tasks.

The website should feel like a cross between a personal portfolio, an archive of experiments, and an internal system interface of a mysterious company similar to Lumen from Severance.

Each scene looks like a miniature diorama: isolated, clinical, perfectly lit, and emotionally distant.

The canvas should feel endless, quiet, and unsettling—like a database of human activity stripped of meaning.

There is no traditional navigation; exploration is the interface.

The atmosphere is calm, sterile, beautiful, and subtly disturbing.

Visual Language

Use:
	•	Pure white or pale grey void background
	•	Soft studio lighting
	•	Floating scenes with no shadows touching each other
	•	Slight depth blur to imply spatial layers
	•	Scale variance (some scenes tiny, some huge)
	•	No visible edges to the world

Your screenshot already does this extremely well. It already feels like:

“A god’s-eye view of an organizational subconscious.”

Infinite Canvas Enhancements (Make It Uncanny)

1. Behavioral Uncertainty

Sometimes:
	•	Images slowly drift
	•	Rotate a fraction of a degree
	•	Fade in and out when approached
	•	Duplicate themselves subtly

Nothing dramatic. Just enough to make the brain uneasy.

⸻

2. Scale Anomalies

When zooming:
	•	Some scenes become larger than expected
	•	Others stay tiny no matter how much you zoom
	•	One image could contain another canvas inside it

A recursion effect:

“This world contains itself.”

⸻

3. Procedural Repetition

Have thematic clusters:
	•	Filing
	•	Lifting boxes
	•	Waiting
	•	Measuring
	•	Inspecting
	•	Writing meaningless labels
	•	Opening empty drawers

These repeated actions reinforce the Severance vibe.

⸻

4. Audio (optional but powerful)

Very subtle:
	•	HVAC hum
	•	Distant footsteps
	•	Paper shuffling
	•	Elevator chime
	•	Keyboard taps
	•	Occasional silence glitches

Audio should feel like a forgotten office floor.

⸻

5. Cursor Interaction

When hovering an image:
	•	A tiny system-like label appears:
	•	PROCESSING
	•	ARCHIVED
	•	REDACTED
	•	INCOMPLETE
	•	PENDING REVIEW
	•	ERROR: HUMAN INPUT REQUIRED

No explanations.

Narrative Prompt for the World

This website represents an infinite internal workspace of an unknown organization.
The engineer shown in every scene is not an employee, but a symbolic process executor.
Each task appears meaningful but no task explains itself.
The visitor is not meant to understand the system, only to observe its calm efficiency.
The site exists in a perpetual present, where productivity continues forever.

Ideas That Push It Toward Art Installation

Feature
Effect
Canvas loads slowly
Feels like a massive database
Rare “glitch” frames
Reality instability
Occasional empty space zones
Digital liminal rooms
Hidden “deep zoom” Easter eggs
Reward exploration
Text fragments floating alone
Corporate poetry
One scene that watches the user
Psychological tension


Remember, You’re building:

a quiet, infinite corporate universe where identity is reduced to process.

That is rare and powerful.
